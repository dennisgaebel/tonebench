					<h1>Shop Policies</h1>
					<p>The following are policies as they pertain to customers of Tonebench. If you have any questions about the policies listed below please let me know and I'll be happy to answer any questions in order to set your mind at ease.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Payments</h2>
                </header>
                <p>All payments are due once work is completed and scheduled for pickup. No instrument(s) may leave my shop until payment has been received in full; no exceptions. A payment plan can be arranged if needed however, you will be charged a storage fee beyond 10 days at the rate explained below as well as a 25% fee added to the total amount due for tardiness. No personal checks are accepted.</p>

                    <h2>Repairs/Setups</h2>
                </header>
                <p>All customers will be given an adequate window (30-45min) to feel out their instrument(s). This is YOUR personal and intimate time to decide if any minor adjustments are desired, and the time for me to complete those said adjustments. Once an instrument leaves my shop the work is complete. All customers are welcome to return for further refinements if needed, but will be charged a bench fee along with any additional costs each visit. An appointment will have to be scheduled for each additional visit.</p>

                    <h2>Pickup/Storage</h2>
                </header>
                <p>All customers receive 10 days from the time of completion notification to pickup their instrument(s). Anything beyond 10 days of repair completion/notification will be charged a storage fee of $35 per day. Once an instrument has been set to storage mode (after 10days) you will be completely opted out of any insurance that protects your instrument in cases such as theft, fire, flood etc. No instrument(s) will be protected once they go beyond the pickup time frame of 10 days or less. I only keep and protect an instrument during it's repair & pickup window. By sending an instrument to my shop you automatically are included in this policy.</p>

                    <h2>Rush Fees</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Regardless of my work que ayone that brings rush work into my shop will be charged a rush fee of $125 along with my repair costs for the work requested.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Refunds</h2>
                </header>
                <p>At this time there are no refunds given for repair work. I take great pride in what I do, and pour a large amount of love into the work. I have no plans on returning instruments with sub-par repair work and why I don't issue refunds. Rest assured your instrument will be repaired with quality and given the highest level of care and attention. Each instrument I touch for repair work is also photographed at close range and posted on Instagram under my username @tonebench. If you decide for any reason to revoke your repair during the work you will be charged 75% of the total estimate given.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Pickup & Delivery</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I'm happy to pickup and deliver your instrument(s) if desired. The fee for pickup and delivery is $40 and covers the general Nashville area (10-15miles). If you live outside this distance (Franklin for example) you will be charged a minimum of $40 for each distance traveled (to, from, back). This equates to 3 trips in total at $40 per trip.</p>

            <article>
                <header>
                    <h2>Consultations/Appointments</h2>
                </header>
                <p>All scheduled appointments are free of charge. Each customer is given a 30-45min window to discuss the repair request, and it's realistic needs upon my review. Please keep to this time limit in order to ensure we use your time wisely. Anything beyond your appointment time frame stated above will be charged an extra bench fee of $40. I love spending the time to chat and looking things over while getting to know you, but I also have to be aware of my time and work that also requires my attention during each working day. Please make sure to be timely with your appointments as well. I understand traffic can be rough in Nashville however, you might run a risk of running into another scheduled appontment. Please communicate with me if you're gonna be tardy to ensure you're not interrupting someone elses appointment.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Estimates</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Estimates are just that. They are hypothesized guesstimations of the work required. Anything in this world that needs fixing is hard to see with 20/20 vision. Your estimate is just a guess and I reserve the right to communicate with you when I see situations of the estimate sliding beyond what it was expected to be. This is the reality of life.</p>
